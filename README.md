# Data-Analytics Internship KPMG
This repository contains the project/tasks I did for the Data Analytics Virtual Internship.

This is the Virtual internship offered by the KPMG through insidesherpa. This internship builds the skills needed for performing data analytics and display insights of data using interactive dashboards.

Through this internship I worked on followings tasks:
1. Email writing after exploring data and assessing its quality.
2. Presenting the strategies and valuable insights to be developed as a presentation before performing the visualization.
3. Using Tableau and Power BI to make interactive dashboards and present our insights.

The quality of the data is much important and it should be under consideration first. So, this internship takes us through three modules/tasks which involves:

-> Data Quality Assessment

-> Data insights

-> Data insights and presentations

The KPMG provides us with the three datasets from the Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. These datasets are assessed for its quality, then analyzed and the findings are presented in the form of dashboards.
